# Bio

I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Graduate School of AI at [Seoul National University][1], and a researcher at [AIIS][2], advised by [Prof. Byoung-Tak Zhang][3]. My research straddles machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. I'm particularly interested in [grounded language learning][4] which aims to connect language to non-linguistic experiences like sensory perception and action. The long-term goal of my research is to build machines that can (i) perceive their everyday surroundings, (ii) communicate with humans via natural language, and (iii) make reliable decisions using language, vision, etc.    

Prior to joining Ph.D. program, I did my master study in Cognitive Science at [Seoul National University][1]. Studying cognitive science has had a great influence on my research. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Ajou University][5].
